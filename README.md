1. Frontend Development
Blueprint Upload UI: Develop the interface to upload room blueprints. This includes drag-and-drop or file selection, image previews, and error handling for file types.
3D Visualization Component: Use Three.js to render the generated 3D model of the room and furniture. Implement controls for zoom, pan, and rotate.
Furniture Recommendation Display: Design a section for suggested furniture items, where users can drag and drop items into the 3D scene.
User Interface and Navigation: Create core navigation (Home, Upload, View Model) and integrate styling for a seamless user experience.
2. Backend Development
Blueprint Processing Endpoint: Create an API route to handle blueprint uploads and forward the file to the AI processing module.
3D Model Generation API: Develop an endpoint that, upon receiving blueprint data, returns 3D model data (e.g., room layout with walls, doors, windows).
Furniture Recommendation API: Design an endpoint that takes room characteristics and returns furniture recommendations, including positions and dimensions for realistic placements.
User Management: If needed, set up user registration, authentication, and data storage (e.g., userâ€™s saved designs).
3. AI and Image Processing
Blueprint Parsing and Layout Detection:
Use OpenCV and OCR to detect walls, windows, and doors.
Develop or integrate a deep learning model (e.g., Mask R-CNN or YOLO) for layout recognition.
3D Model Generation:
Convert parsed layout data into 3D geometry for walls, floors, and key room features using Blender (for creating exportable 3D models) or directly in Three.js.
Furniture Recommendation Engine:
Create a model or rule-based system to recommend furniture based on room dimensions and style preferences.
Implement filters for room type (e.g., bedroom, living room) and furniture types.
4. Data Storage and Database Management
Blueprint and Model Data: Store user-uploaded blueprints and generated 3D model data in a database (MongoDB or Firebase).
Furniture Inventory Database: Create a database of furniture items, including properties like dimensions, styles, colors, and images.
User Preferences and Saved Designs: Allow users to save room designs, with associated layout data and furniture placements.
5. Testing and Deployment
Testing: Set up unit tests for frontend components, backend routes, and AI processing modules. Run end-to-end tests for user flows.
Frontend Deployment: Use Vercel or Netlify to deploy the frontend for quick, responsive web hosting.
Backend and AI Deployment: Host backend APIs and AI services on AWS, Heroku, or Firebase with cloud storage for uploaded files and processed models.
6. Project Management and Documentation
Task Tracking: Use tools like Jira or Trello to assign tasks and monitor progress across each component.
Documentation: Document the API routes, AI model usage, data flow, and setup instructions. Create user-facing guides if needed.
